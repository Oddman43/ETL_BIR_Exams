# ETL from pdf files 👷🏼 (WIP)
Avg exam -> 8 mins

## Motivation

Last year when I began to study to become an Internal Resident in Biology by myself I knew I needed a way to review exam questions 

Faced with that dilema i began brainstorming and i ended up woth the idea of designing an ETL pipeline to extract the questions from the pdfs and using some kind of Python script and uploading then to Anki using Anki Connect addon so i can review them efficiently.
