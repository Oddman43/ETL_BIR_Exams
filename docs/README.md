# ETL from pdf files 👷🏼 (WIP)
Avg exam -> 8 mins

Total 34 pdfs

## Motivation

Last year when I began to study to become an Internal Resident in Biology by myself I knew I needed a way to review exam questions 

Faced with that dilema i began brainstorming and i ended up woth the idea of designing an ETL pipeline to extract the questions from the pdfs and using some kind of Python script and uploading then to Anki using Anki Connect addon so i can review them efficiently.


## Technologies and Tools Used

* Python 3.xx
* JupyterNotebooks
* PyPdf librabry to extract the text from Pdf files
* Pandas librabry for data cleaning and maniputaltion
* Anki Connect for loading into anki
* SQLite3 for saving to a databass
